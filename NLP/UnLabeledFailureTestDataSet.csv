Samples sent to lab again for further analysis.  - DFW 1/9/2015Root cause associated with not purging compressor with N2 while it was down during 2014.  Rust blossoms from suction lines and bottles contaminated compressor valves.  MJL 4/24/2015Ops Finding: C-308 was brought down proactively to repair valves showing signs of damage.  When the compressor was cleared and opened for maintenance, deposits were identified in the drains off the compressor suction bottle.  The amount of deposits required additional cleaning and line clearing before the compressor can be returned to service, extending the equipment downtime.  IMPACT 832970"

11060637,"Notification ID: 12488470Eng Finding: failed a 1HP discharge valve on 8/31 at noon. The compressor ran until 6 am on 9/01. The trip occurred during a trap blow down. The 3HP suction pressure dropped 60 psig to 962 psig. During that pressure drop, the 3HP xhead vibration spiked to above 3.4 gs. and the compressor tripped. The valve failure was caused by some incompressible hitting the discharge valve moppet.Findings and adjustments:massive 1HP dischagre valve leak. 1 HP valve are touching off on the liner. a larger gasket was installed to lift the valve off of the liner.Sand was poured  below the 3 HP cross head as a test to dampen vibrations in the 3 HP crosshead. - PT 9/8/2015"
