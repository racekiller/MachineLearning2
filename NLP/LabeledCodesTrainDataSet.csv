During that pressure drop, the 3HP xhead vibration spiked to above 3.4 gs. and the compressor tripped. The valve failure was caused by some incompressible hitting the discharge valve moppet.Findings and adjustments:massive 1HP dischagre valve leak. 1 HP valve are touching off on the liner. a larger gasket was installed to lift the valve off of the liner.Sand was poured  below the 3 HP cross head as a test to dampen vibrations in the 3 HP crosshead. - PT 9/8/2015",C-308 MANUAL OUTAGE,2HP_3LP_VLV,CONTAM,REPLACE11066683,1,"Notification ID: 12495504Eng Findings: 3 LP failure caused by liquid production in the cylinder.

All valves were replaced, and the whole piston rod assembly was replaced. The ring grooves on the piston are non standard so the whole assembly is replaced. We also drained and refilled the lbe oil reservoir because the Tan (total acid number) was high. this ultimatley was being caused by oxygen in the oil reservoir. We found the nitrogen purge off on all thre compressors. - PT 12/15/2015The valves failed due to liquid condensing from the process gas.

All of these valves ran more than 2 years. 2 HP initiated the repair when the valve body bolt came loose and floated into a valve port. The bolt held a moppet upen and mimicked a valve failure. 1 HP was also exhibiting a small leakage. 3HP PV looked like bad piston rings.during the repair we pulled the piston on 3HP to replace the rings. the rings were in really good condition. There was little to no wear on the piston rings so the piston was reinstalled.Delayed restart selected because during the reinstallation of the piston rod the crosshead started lifting. The Dresser crew lost maybe a shift trying to get the crosshead to sit down. Eventually we found anumber of burrs or nick marks on the leveling washer. I can only summize that these burrs were bending the rod when torque was applied.

Investigation into trip ongoing. After the  loss of the C-307,  operators where preparing maching for a possible restart the operators opened manual spill backs which allowed system pressure to drop and cause loss of flow through 1st Stg East and West heaters. The 3lp discharge check on C307 appears to have leaked by allowing the system to depressurize. Lack of forward flow and leaking check valve caused LP header @ PC500  to open to the flare causing an environmental event on both the HP and LP flares. During the loss of pressure to the unit C300 lost sufficient DP across compressor to maintain min flow at FC38 causing a loss of the 2nd stage heater.
